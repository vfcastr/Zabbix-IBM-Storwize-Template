# üì° Zabbix Template - IBM Storwize via SSH

Template for monitoring IBM Storwize (v3700, v5000, v7000, SVC) via SSH in Zabbix 7+ environments.

> ‚úÖ Designed for production environments using a read-only user.

---

## üîç Overview

This template collects key storage metrics directly via Storwize CLI over SSH, converts output to JSON, and makes it available to Zabbix.

---

## üß† How IBM Storwize Works

IBM Storwize uses physical drives grouped into arrays with RAID (RAID-5/6/10), which form MDisks. MDisks are assigned to storage pools, from which logical volumes (vDisks) are created and exposed to hosts. The system is managed through two or more node canisters that monitor hardware components like batteries, PSUs, drives, fans, and internal links.

## üßæ Zabbix Pre-processing Logic

- SSH master item executes the full command (with `-delim :`)
- Dependent items extract metrics using JSONPath and regular expressions
- Outputs are split by sections using markers like `##BEGIN:<cmd>` and `##END:<cmd>`
- CSV to JSON conversion simplifies parsing of CLI outputs

---

## üìé Requirements

- Zabbix 6 or later
- IBM Storwize user with read-only permissions
- SSH user/password

---

## ‚úÖ Template Status

- [x] All core items implemented
- [x] Modular structure by CLI command
- [x] JSONPath and regex pre-processing

---

## üìå Future Improvements

- Provide a sample Grafana dashboard
